# Delete Account
## v0.2.1.14

- To delete your account and all its data, you can send a request to the email address gizserbes@gmail.com.
- The request should be issued from the address that was used to register in the application.

- We do not collect data that can be attributed to a specific user if the user is not logged in using Google Accounts or an email address and we cannot delete what we do not have.

- For users without authorization, the data is stored locally on the device and to delete it, simply clear the application data or delete the application from your device.
